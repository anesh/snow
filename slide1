Slide Title:
Standard Change Creation (Create Only)

Bullet Points:

Standard Change is automatically created only for 'Create' mode requests

Triggered after the successful submission of a new configuration request

The Standard Change is linked to the same Request Item (RITM) that created the F5 configuration

Includes metadata such as FQDN, environment, VIP, port, and submitter

Enables automated change tracking and compliance with CAB processes

Not triggered during 'Modify' or 'Rollback' workflows â€” those rely on existing change records or audit trail

Enhances traceability and change audit compliance without manual intervention
