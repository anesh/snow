Slide Title:
Ansible Integration for F5 Configuration Deployment

Bullet Points:

After approval and standard change creation, ServiceNow triggers Ansible playbooks to push F5 configuration changes

Integration is done via REST API

Submitted config data (VIP, pool, monitor, persistence) is converted to YAML

Execution status is reported back to ServiceNow and logged in the request or task record

Errors or failures are captured and trigger follow-up tasks

Enables zero-touch, auditable network automation from a ServiceNow
