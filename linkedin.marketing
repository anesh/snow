üöÄ Now Live: F5 Load Balancer Automation for ServiceNow

Managing F5 configurations manually? Updating pool members by email or Slack?

We just launched SN-F5 Automator ‚Äî a fully integrated ServiceNow solution to:

‚úÖ Provision F5 VIPs and pools via a Service Catalog
‚úÖ Modify existing configs by FQDN lookup
‚úÖ Auto-create Standard Changes for approvals
‚úÖ Version every config with rollback support
‚úÖ Trigger deployments via Ansible Tower or AAP

üîê Built with auditability, enterprise scale, and minimal operational friction in mind.

üéØ Ideal for:

Network teams managing app onboarding

ServiceNow architects looking to extend automation

Platform teams rolling out self-service load balancing

üõ†Ô∏è Works with both Classic UI and Service Portal
üìÑ Deployment guide + support included

LinkedIn DM: Lead Follow-up
Hi [First Name],

Thanks for checking out our post on F5 Load Balancer Automation for ServiceNow ‚Äî glad it caught your attention.

We‚Äôve helped teams automate everything from F5 VIP provisioning to rollback and Ansible-based deployment ‚Äî all from the ServiceNow catalog, with built-in versioning and change control.

If this is something your team could benefit from, I‚Äôd be happy to show you a quick 15-min demo or share more details.

Would that be useful to you or someone on your infra/platform team?

Cheers,
[Your Name]

Hi [First Name],

Noticed you liked our post on SN-F5 Automator. We‚Äôre helping teams move from ticket-based F5 changes to fully automated workflows in ServiceNow.

Happy to share a live walkthrough or answer any questions if that‚Äôs relevant to your roadmap.

Open to a quick chat?
=========================

Did you know you can fully version F5 VIP configurations using just ServiceNow + a few client scripts?
We used GlideModal + Script Include + MRVS to create an editable, rollback-friendly VIP config workflow.
#SNDev #NetworkAutomation #ServiceNow

Most teams update F5 load balancers manually.
But with the right ServiceNow form, they can create or modify configs self-service ‚Äî with approval, rollback, and audit.
Here‚Äôs what we learned implementing it.

What if modifying a load balancer config was just filling out a ServiceNow form?
That‚Äôs how we simplified F5 changes for app teams and still enforced governance.

GlideModal in ServiceNow is underrated.
We used it to create a modal editor for F5 pool members with dynamic row editing, validation, and rollback.
Ask me how we handled version control on submission.

We recently helped a team build F5 automation into ServiceNow.
The trickiest part? Versioning and MRVS updates ‚Äî especially when loading data for Modify mode.
Here‚Äôs how we overcame it üëá

Client script tip:
You can populate multiple Multi-Row Variable Sets in ServiceNow from a single GlideAjax response ‚Äî great for complex config UIs like F5 or firewall rules.

Rollback isn‚Äôt just for code.
It applies to infrastructure configs too.
We version every F5 config change, so rollback is a button click ‚Äî and linked to the request that made it.
This makes CAB reviews much easier.

Ansible + ServiceNow works beautifully.
We use Flow Designer to call an Ansible job template right after F5 form submission ‚Äî clean, auditable deployment pipeline.

Want to make a dynamic config editor in ServiceNow?
Use a UI Macro to trigger a GlideModal ‚Üí UI Page ‚Üí Client Script ‚Üí Script Include loop.
That‚Äôs how we enabled FQDN-based config lookup for F5 automation.

Standard Change creation doesn‚Äôt have to be manual.
We trigger it automatically on ServiceNow form submission ‚Äî but only for 'Create' mode.
Modify uses version diffing instead.

How do you manage audit for infrastructure changes?
We version every config, link it to the RITM, and provide rollback in the same UI.
No extra tools needed ‚Äî just the ServiceNow platform.

Good UX matters ‚Äî even in internal tools.
Our ServiceNow config form for F5 has dropdowns, field dependencies, validation, and loading spinners.
It‚Äôs fast and safe.

Tip for multi-site load balancers:
Use a single table and differentiate primary vs secondary members via a site_type field.
Makes MRVS mapping in ServiceNow much easier.

Don‚Äôt skip versioning.
We learned the hard way: if configs can change outside of CAB, you need a snapshot per version ‚Äî not just sys_updated_on.

One small win:
Using g_form.getValue() with JSON-encoded MRVS lets us restore multiple member sets in one call.
Perfect for rollback and Modify mode.

Lessons from automating F5 with ServiceNow:

MRVS fields aren't easy to manipulate

GlideModal is your best friend

You don‚Äôt need mid servers for everything

Users care about rollback more than they think

ServiceNow isn‚Äôt just for tickets.
We use it to manage real-time infrastructure: load balancer configs, deployment metadata, and rollback automation ‚Äî all without custom portals.

Trying to balance speed + control?
We let teams self-service F5 changes ‚Äî but every change creates a version and optionally a change request.
No more shadow IT, no more delays.

Infra automation works better with approvals.
We automatically create standard changes in ServiceNow when a new F5 config is created.
Modify uses version rollback logic instead.

MRVS isn‚Äôt friendly to incremental updates.
But with GlideAjax and full JSON rewrites, you can simulate dynamic row editing with full control.
That‚Äôs how we handled primary and secondary pool members in one workflow.
